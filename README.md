This repository is for practicing the GitHub flow.

Hello (for anyone reading this)! I am active duty Navy (As of 01AUG2025), with a few years left on my contract. When finished, I'll have been in for 11 years. I plan on reenlisting into the reserves to finish off my 20. I have a wife and 4 kids and am originally from Washington State. I plan on becoming a software engineer or cybersecurity analyst when I leave active duty. I'm taking the necessary steps to hopefully make that happen!
